# Flight reservation system
WIP. The idea is to browse flights from airports all over the world, with live data. Data with airports, airlines & routes is collected from CSV files, then processed by java streams, to eventually populate tables. Data from external API is processed and then saved to DB, but with scheduled deletion after a day in order to maintain only present set of data.

Co-engineered with Dariusz Ochota, he's responsible for frontend part:
