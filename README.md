# Flight reservation system
Work in progress.
At this moment app has been divided into __7 mircroservices__, for now only tested with Postman.  
Monolith version with more tests can be found at second branch.  

Right now User can see __live delays__ thanks to external api from airlabs.co  
and also check all available Routes from one of 452 largest Airports.  <br>
  
Data has been collected from several public databases.  <br>

Stateless registration with JWT is on the way.  <br>

Frontend part available thanks to Dariusz Ochota:  <br>
