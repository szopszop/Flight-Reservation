# Flight-Reservation
Work in progress.<br>
At this moment app has been divided into __7 microservices__, for now tested only with Postman.<br>
Monolith version is available at the second branch, with more tests.  <br>

Right now User can:<br>
* View __live data with plane delays__ thanks to airlabs.co external API.  <br>
* Check available Routes for Airport, Airports within Country and such.<br>

Stateless registration with JWT in on the way.<br>

In order to use it you need to get a free API key from airlabs.co.


Frontend part available thanks to Dariusz Ochota:  <br>
